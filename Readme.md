# Machine Learning (from scratch) Journey  

This repository documents my journey of understanding the **mathematics and intuition** behind machine learning algorithms.  
I aim to implement ML algorithms **from scratch** as I learn them, to deepen my grasp of both theory and practice.  

Each concept will have its own folder containing:  
- Python implementation(s) from scratch  
- Jupyter notebooks with demonstrations using generated data      

## Implemented so far  
- [Linear Regression](./linear_regression)
