# Linear Regression (Univariate)  

This folder contains my implementation of a **univariate linear regression model** built completely from scratch (using only `numpy`).  
Currently, it supports training with gradient descent and evaluation with root mean squared error and mean square error.  

Planned improvements:  
- Extend to **multivariate linear regression**.  
- Implement evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, RÂ²)
