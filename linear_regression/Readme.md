# Linear Regression (Now Multivariate)  

This folder contains my implementation of a **linear regression model** built completely from scratch (using only `numpy`).  
Currently, it supports training with batch gradient descent and evaluation with root mean squared error and mean square error.  

Improvements from previous implementation:  
- Extended to **multivariate linear regression**.  
- Implemented evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE,RMSE)
